# Word-count
## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from a text.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Open the file in read mode and handle it in test mood.
### Step 2: 
 Read the text using read() function.
### Step 3: 
 Split the text using space separator.We assume that words in a sentance are separted by a space character.
### Step 4:  
The length of the split list should equal the numbers of words in the test file.
### Step 5: 
You can refine the count by cleaning the string prior to splitting or validating the words after splitting.
### Step 6: 
End the program.

## PROGRAM:

fname=input("enter the file name:")
num_words=0
with open(fname,'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        words=line.split()
        num_words+=len(words)
print('Number of words:Â ',num_words)

```
